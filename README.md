# Netflix-Product-BI-Analysis
SQL-based Product &amp; business Intelligence analysis using Netflix user behavior data

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Netflix user behavior to answer key product, business,
and recommendation performance questions using PostgreSQL.

## 🧠 Business Questions Answered
1. Which movies have the highest watch completion rate?
2. Which genres are most popular across countries?
3. What percentage of recommendations lead to a watch?
4. Who are the most active users and what do they watch?
5. How does engagement differ by subscription type?
6. How long it takes a new user to have their first meaningful interaction (first watch)?

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- SQL (Joins, Aggregations, CTEs, Window Functions)
- PgAdmin
- Kaggle Dataset

## 📊 Key Insights
